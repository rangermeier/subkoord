Loose group management tool with calendar, wiki and newsletter application.
This application was originally written for the art space [Subterrarium](http://www.subterrarium.at).

Its main purpose, the **calendar**, is to organise chores between staff on a voluntary basis. This is implemented by 
defining types of events with certain tasks. Each event in the calendar is of one type and has thus a pre-defined list 
of tasks. Members can sign upfor this tasks. If an event has open tasks the application will send out e-mails.

The **wiki** is a very basic affair, no revisions, etc.

The **newsletter** application allows to have muliple lists. Subscribers can be added manually by administrators or via
public formular by anyone (requiring e-mail confirmation). Newsletters can contain links for unsubscribing. There's 
basic support for handling bounces.
